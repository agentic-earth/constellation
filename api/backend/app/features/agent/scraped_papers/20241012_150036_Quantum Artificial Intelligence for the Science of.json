    "abstract": "  Climate change has become one of the biggest global problems increasingly\ncompromising the Earth's habitability. Recent developments such as the\nextraordinary heat waves in California & Canada, and the devastating floods in\nGermany point to the role of climate change in the ever-increasing frequency of\nextreme weather. Numerical modelling of the weather and climate have seen\ntremendous improvements in the last five decades, yet stringent limitations\nremain to be overcome. Spatially and temporally localized forecasting is the\nneed of the hour for effective adaptation measures towards minimizing the loss\nof life and property. Artificial Intelligence-based methods are demonstrating\npromising results in improving predictions, but are still limited by the\navailability of requisite hardware and software required to process the vast\ndeluge of data at a scale of the planet Earth. Quantum computing is an emerging\nparadigm that has found potential applicability in several fields. In this\nopinion piece, we argue that new developments in Artificial Intelligence\nalgorithms designed for quantum computers - also known as Quantum Artificial\nIntelligence (QAI) - may provide the key breakthroughs necessary to furthering\nthe science of climate change. The resultant improvements in weather and\nclimate forecasts are expected to cascade to numerous societal benefits.\n",
