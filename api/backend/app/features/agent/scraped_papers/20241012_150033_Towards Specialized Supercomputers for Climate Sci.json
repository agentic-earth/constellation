    "abstract": "  We discuss the computational challenges and requirements for high-resolution\nclimate simulations using the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate\nModel (ICON). We define a detailed requirements model for ICON which emphasizes\nthe need for specialized supercomputers to accurately predict climate change\nimpacts and extreme weather events. Based on the requirements model, we outline\ncomputational demands for km-scale simulations, and suggests machine learning\ntechniques to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Our findings aim to guide\nthe design of future supercomputers for advanced climate science.\n",
