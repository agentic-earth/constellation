    "abstract": "  Systems exhibiting nonlinear dynamics, including but not limited to chaos,\nare ubiquitous across Earth Sciences such as Meteorology, Hydrology, Climate\nand Ecology, as well as Biology such as neural and cardiac processes. However,\nSystem Identification remains a challenge. In climate and earth systems models,\nwhile governing equations follow from first principles and understanding of key\nprocesses has steadily improved, the largest uncertainties are often caused by\nparameterizations such as cloud physics, which in turn have witnessed limited\nimprovements over the last several decades. Climate scientists have pointed to\nMachine Learning enhanced parameter estimation as a possible solution, with\nproof-of-concept methodological adaptations being examined on idealized\nsystems. While climate science has been highlighted as a \"Big Data\" challenge\nowing to the volume and complexity of archived model-simulations and\nobservations from remote and in-situ sensors, the parameter estimation process\nis often relatively a \"small data\" problem. A crucial question for data\nscientists in this context is the relevance of state-of-the-art data-driven\napproaches including those based on deep neural networks or kernel-based\nprocesses. Here we consider a chaotic system - two-level Lorenz-96 - used as a\nbenchmark model in the climate science literature, adopt a methodology based on\nGaussian Processes for parameter estimation and compare the gains in predictive\nunderstanding with a suite of Deep Learning and strawman Linear Regression\nmethods. Our results show that adaptations of kernel-based Gaussian Processes\ncan outperform other approaches under small data constraints along with\nuncertainty quantification; and needs to be considered as a viable approach in\nclimate science and earth system modeling.\n",
