    "abstract": "  Data-driven machine learning models for weather forecasting have made\ntransformational progress in the last 1-2 years, with state-of-the-art ones now\noutperforming the best physics-based models for a wide range of skill scores.\nGiven the strong links between weather and climate modelling, this raises the\nquestion whether machine learning models could also revolutionize climate\nscience, for example by informing mitigation and adaptation to climate change\nor to generate larger ensembles for more robust uncertainty estimates. Here, we\nshow that current state-of-the-art machine learning models trained for weather\nforecasting in present-day climate produce skillful forecasts across different\nclimate states corresponding to pre-industrial, present-day, and future 2.9K\nwarmer climates. This indicates that the dynamics shaping the weather on short\ntimescales may not differ fundamentally in a changing climate. It also\ndemonstrates out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of the machine\nlearning models that are a critical prerequisite for climate applications.\nNonetheless, two of the models show a global-mean cold bias in the forecasts\nfor the future warmer climate state, i.e. they drift towards the colder\npresent-day climate they have been trained for. A similar result is obtained\nfor the pre-industrial case where two out of three models show a warming. We\ndiscuss possible remedies for these biases and analyze their spatial\ndistribution, revealing complex warming and cooling patterns that are partly\nrelated to missing ocean-sea ice and land surface information in the training\ndata. Despite these current limitations, our results suggest that data-driven\nmachine learning models will provide powerful tools for climate science and\ntransform established approaches by complementing conventional physics-based\nmodels.\n",
