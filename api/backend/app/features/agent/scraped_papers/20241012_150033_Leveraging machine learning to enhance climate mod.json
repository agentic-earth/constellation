    "abstract": "  Recent achievements in machine learning (Ml) have had a significant impact on\nvarious fields, including climate science. Climate modeling is very important\nand plays a crucial role in shaping the decisions of governments and\nindividuals in mitigating the impact of climate change. Climate change poses a\nserious threat to humanity, however, current climate models are limited by\ncomputational costs, uncertainties, and biases, affecting their prediction\naccuracy. The vast amount of climate data generated by satellites, radars, and\nearth system models (ESMS) poses a significant challenge. ML techniques can be\neffectively employed to analyze this data and extract valuable insights that\naid in our understanding of the earth climate. This review paper focuses on how\nml has been utilized in the last 5 years to boost the current state-of-the-art\nclimate models. We invite the ml community to join in the global effort to\naccurately model the earth climate by collaborating with other fields to\nleverage ml as a powerful tool in this endeavor.\n",
