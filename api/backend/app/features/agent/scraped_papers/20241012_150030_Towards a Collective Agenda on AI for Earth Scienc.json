    "abstract": "  In the last years we have witnessed the fields of geosciences and remote\nsensing and artificial intelligence to become closer. Thanks to both the\nmassive availability of observational data, improved simulations, and\nalgorithmic advances, these disciplines have found common objectives and\nchallenges to advance the modeling and understanding of the Earth system.\nDespite such great opportunities, we also observed a worrying tendency to\nremain in disciplinary comfort zones applying recent advances from artificial\nintelligence on well resolved remote sensing problems. Here we take a position\non research directions where we think the interface between these fields will\nhave the most impact and become potential game changers. In our declared agenda\nfor AI on Earth sciences, we aim to inspire researchers, especially the younger\ngenerations, to tackle these challenges for a real advance of remote sensing\nand the geosciences.\n",
