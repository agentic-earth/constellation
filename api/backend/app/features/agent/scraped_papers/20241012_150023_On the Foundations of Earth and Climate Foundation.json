    "abstract": "  Foundation models have enormous potential in advancing Earth and climate\nsciences, however, current approaches may not be optimal as they focus on a few\nbasic features of a desirable Earth and climate foundation model. Crafting the\nideal Earth foundation model, we define eleven features which would allow such\na foundation model to be beneficial for any geoscientific downstream\napplication in an environmental- and human-centric manner.We further shed light\non the way forward to achieve the ideal model and to evaluate Earth foundation\nmodels. What comes after foundation models? Energy efficient adaptation,\nadversarial defenses, and interpretability are among the emerging directions.\n",
