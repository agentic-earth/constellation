    "abstract": "  We propose a hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) climate modeling approach\nthat enables climate modelers in scientific discovery using a climate-targeted\nsimulation methodology based on a novel combination of deep neural networks and\nmathematical methods for modeling dynamical systems. The simulations are\ngrounded by a neuro-symbolic language that both enables question answering of\nwhat is learned by the AI methods and provides a means of explainability. We\ndescribe how this methodology can be applied to the discovery of climate\ntipping points and, in particular, the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional\nOverturning Circulation (AMOC). We show how this methodology is able to predict\nAMOC collapse with a high degree of accuracy using a surrogate climate model\nfor ocean interaction. We also show preliminary results of neuro-symbolic\nmethod performance when translating between natural language questions and\nsymbolically learned representations. Our AI methodology shows promising early\nresults, potentially enabling faster climate tipping point related research\nthat would otherwise be computationally infeasible.\n",
