In particular, RICE-N supports modeling\nregional decision-making using AI agents. Furthermore, the IAM then models the\nclimate-economic impact of those decisions into the future.\n  Whereas the first track focused only on performance metrics, the proposals\nsubmitted to the second track were evaluated both quantitatively and\nqualitatively. The quantitative evaluation focused on a combination of (i) the\ndegree of mitigation of global temperature rise and (ii) the increase in\neconomic productivity.

Contaminated sites often require decades to\nremediate or to monitor natural attenuation. Climate change exacerbates the\nlong-term site management problem because extreme precipitation and/or shifts\nin precipitation/evapotranspiration regimes could re-mobilize contaminants and\nproliferate affected groundwater. To quickly assess the spatiotemporal\nvariations of groundwater contamination under uncertain climate disturbances,\nwe developed a physics-informed machine learning surrogate model using U-Net\nenhanced Fourier Neural Operator (U-FNO) to solve Partial Differential\nEquations (PDEs) of groundwater flow and transport simulations at the site\nscale.We develop a combined loss function that includes both data-driven\nfactors and physical boundary constraints at multiple spatiotemporal scales.\nOur U-FNOs can reliably predict the spatiotemporal variations of groundwater\nflow and contaminant transport properties from 1954 to 2100 with realistic\nclimate projections. In parallel, we develop a convolutional autoencoder\ncombined with online clustering to reduce the dimensionality of the vast\nhistorical and projected climate data by quantifying climatic region\nsimilarities across the United States.
