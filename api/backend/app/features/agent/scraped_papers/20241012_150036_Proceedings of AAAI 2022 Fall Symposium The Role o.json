    "abstract": "  Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, requiring\nrapid action across society. As artificial intelligence tools (AI) are rapidly\ndeployed, it is therefore crucial to understand how they will impact climate\naction. On the one hand, AI can support applications in climate change\nmitigation (reducing or preventing greenhouse gas emissions), adaptation\n(preparing for the effects of a changing climate), and climate science. These\napplications have implications in areas ranging as widely as energy,\nagriculture, and finance. At the same time, AI is used in many ways that hinder\nclimate action (e.g., by accelerating the use of greenhouse gas-emitting fossil\nfuels). In addition, AI technologies have a carbon and energy footprint\nthemselves. This symposium brought together participants from across academia,\nindustry, government, and civil society to explore these intersections of AI\nwith climate change, as well as how each of these sectors can contribute to\nsolutions.\n",
