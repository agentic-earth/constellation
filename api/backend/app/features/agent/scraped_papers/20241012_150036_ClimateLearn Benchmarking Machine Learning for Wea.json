    "abstract": "  Modeling weather and climate is an essential endeavor to understand the near-\nand long-term impacts of climate change, as well as inform technology and\npolicymaking for adaptation and mitigation efforts. In recent years, there has\nbeen a surging interest in applying data-driven methods based on machine\nlearning for solving core problems such as weather forecasting and climate\ndownscaling. Despite promising results, much of this progress has been impaired\ndue to the lack of large-scale, open-source efforts for reproducibility,\nresulting in the use of inconsistent or underspecified datasets, training\nsetups, and evaluations by both domain scientists and artificial intelligence\nresearchers. We introduce ClimateLearn, an open-source PyTorch library that\nvastly simplifies the training and evaluation of machine learning models for\ndata-driven climate science. ClimateLearn consists of holistic pipelines for\ndataset processing (e.g., ERA5, CMIP6, PRISM), implementation of\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., Transformers, ResNets), and\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation for standard weather and climate\nmodeling tasks. We supplement these functionalities with extensive\ndocumentation, contribution guides, and quickstart tutorials to expand access\nand promote community growth. We have also performed comprehensive forecasting\nand downscaling experiments to showcase the capabilities and key features of\nour library. To our knowledge, ClimateLearn is the first large-scale,\nopen-source effort for bridging research in weather and climate modeling with\nmodern machine learning systems. Our library is available publicly at\nhttps://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn.\n",
