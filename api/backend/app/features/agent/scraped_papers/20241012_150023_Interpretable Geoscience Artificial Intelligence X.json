    "abstract": "  As Earth science enters the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) not\nonly offers great potential for solving geoscience problems, but also plays a\ncritical role in accelerating the understanding of the complex, interactive,\nand multiscale processes of Earth's behavior. As geoscience AI models are\nprogressively utilized for significant predictions in crucial situations,\ngeoscience researchers are increasingly demanding their interpretability and\nversatility. This study proposes an interpretable geoscience artificial\nintelligence (XGeoS-AI) framework to unravel the mystery of image recognition\nin the Earth sciences, and its effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated by\ntaking computed tomography (CT) image recognition as an example. Inspired by\nthe mechanism of human vision, the proposed XGeoS-AI framework generates a\nthreshold value from a local region within the whole image to complete the\nrecognition. Different kinds of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as\nSupport Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN), can be adopted as the AI engines of the proposed XGeoS-AI\nframework to efficiently complete geoscience image recognition tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness, versatility, and\nheuristics of the proposed framework have great potential in solving geoscience\nimage recognition problems. Interpretable AI should receive more and more\nattention in the field of the Earth sciences, which is the key to promoting\nmore rational and wider applications of AI in the field of Earth sciences. In\naddition, the proposed interpretable framework may be the forerunner of\ntechnological innovation in the Earth sciences.\n",
