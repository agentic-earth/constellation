    "abstract": "  We employ a combination of machine learning and first-principles calculations\nto predict magnetic properties of rare-earth lean magnets. For this purpose,\nbased on training set constructed out of experimental data, the machine is\ntrained to make predictions on magnetic transition temperature (Tc), largeness\nof saturation magnetization ({\\mu}0Ms), and nature of the magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy (Ku). Subsequently, the quantitative values of {\\mu}0Ms and Ku of\nthe yet-to-be synthesized compounds, screened by machine learning, are\ncalculated by first-principles density functional theory. The applicability of\nthe proposed technique of combined machine learning and first-principles\ncalculations is demonstrated on 2-17-X magnets, Ce2Fe17-xCoxCN. Further to this\nstudy, we explore stability of the proposed compounds by calculating vacancy\nformation energy of small atom interstitials (N/C). Our study indicates a\nnumber of compounds in the proposed family, offers the possibility to become\nsolution of cheap, and efficient permanent magnet.\n",
