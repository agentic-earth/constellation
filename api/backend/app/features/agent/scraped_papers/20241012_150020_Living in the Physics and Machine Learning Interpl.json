    "abstract": "  Most problems in Earth sciences aim to do inferences about the system, where\naccurate predictions are just a tiny part of the whole problem. Inferences mean\nunderstanding variables relations, deriving models that are physically\ninterpretable, that are simple parsimonious, and mathematically tractable.\nMachine learning models alone are excellent approximators, but very often do\nnot respect the most elementary laws of physics, like mass or energy\nconservation, so consistency and confidence are compromised. In this paper, we\ndescribe the main challenges ahead in the field, and introduce several ways to\nlive in the Physics and machine learning interplay: to encode differential\nequations from data, constrain data-driven models with physics-priors and\ndependence constraints, improve parameterizations, emulate physical models, and\nblend data-driven and process-based models. This is a collective long-term AI\nagenda towards developing and applying algorithms capable of discovering\nknowledge in the Earth system.\n",
