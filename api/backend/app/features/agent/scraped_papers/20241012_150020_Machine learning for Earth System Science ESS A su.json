    "abstract": "  This survey focuses on the current problems in Earth systems science where\nmachine learning algorithms can be applied. It provides an overview of previous\nwork, ongoing work at the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Gov. of India, and future\napplications of ML algorithms to some significant earth science problems. We\nprovide a comparison of previous work with this survey, a mind map of\nmultidimensional areas related to machine learning and a Gartner's hype cycle\nfor machine learning in Earth system science (ESS). We mainly focus on the\ncritical components in Earth Sciences, including atmospheric, Ocean,\nSeismology, and biosphere, and cover AI/ML applications to statistical\ndownscaling and forecasting problems.\n",
