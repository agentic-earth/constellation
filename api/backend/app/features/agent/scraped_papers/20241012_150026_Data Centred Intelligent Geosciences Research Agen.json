    "abstract": "  This paper describes and discusses our vision to develop and reason about\nbest practices and novel ways of curating data-centric geosciences knowledge\n(data, experiments, models, methods, conclusions, and interpretations). This\nknowledge is produced from applying statistical modelling, Machine Learning,\nand modern data analytics methods on geo-data collections. The problems address\nopen methodological questions in model building, models' assessment,\nprediction, and forecasting workflows.\n",
