    "abstract": "  Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) represents an emerging field that\npromises the creation of synthetic data and outputs in different modalities.\nGAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of\napplications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer\nscience, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and\nsustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and\npromises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential\napplications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The\nrecent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have\nenabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction\nproblems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to\ngeoscience and Earth system dynamics. This survey discusses several GAI models\nthat have been used in geoscience comprising generative adversarial networks\n(GANs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and generative pre-trained\ntransformer (GPT)-based structures. These tools have helped the geoscience\ncommunity in several applications, including (but not limited to) data\ngeneration/augmentation, super-resolution, panchromatic sharpening, haze\nremoval, restoration, and land surface changing. Some challenges still remain\nsuch as ensuring physical interpretation, nefarious use cases, and\ntrustworthiness. Beyond that, GAI models show promises to the geoscience\ncommunity, especially with the support to climate change, urban science,\natmospheric science, marine science, and planetary science through their\nextraordinary ability to data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification.\n",
