    "abstract": "  Full-waveform inversion (FWI) plays a vital role in geoscience to explore the\nsubsurface. It utilizes the seismic wave to image the subsurface velocity map.\nAs the machine learning (ML) technique evolves, the data-driven approaches\nusing ML for FWI tasks have emerged, offering enhanced accuracy and reduced\ncomputational cost compared to traditional physics-based methods. However, a\ncommon challenge in geoscience, the unprivileged data, severely limits ML\neffectiveness. The issue becomes even worse during model pruning, a step\nessential in geoscience due to environmental complexities. To tackle this, we\nintroduce the EdGeo toolkit, which employs a diffusion-based model guided by\nphysics principles to generate high-fidelity velocity maps. The toolkit uses\nthe acoustic wave equation to generate corresponding seismic waveform data,\nfacilitating the fine-tuning of pruned ML models. Our results demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in SSIM scores and reduction in both MAE and MSE\nacross various pruning ratios. Notably, the ML model fine-tuned using data\ngenerated by EdGeo yields superior quality of velocity maps, especially in\nrepresenting unprivileged features, outperforming other existing methods.\n",
