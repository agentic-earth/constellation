    "abstract": "  We review how machine learning has transformed our ability to model the Earth\nsystem, and how we expect recent breakthroughs to benefit end-users in\nSwitzerland in the near future. Drawing from our review, we identify three\nrecommendations.\n  Recommendation 1: Develop Hybrid AI-Physical Models: Emphasize the\nintegration of AI and physical modeling for improved reliability, especially\nfor longer prediction horizons, acknowledging the delicate balance between\nknowledge-based and data-driven components required for optimal performance.\nRecommendation 2: Emphasize Robustness in AI Downscaling Approaches, favoring\ntechniques that respect physical laws, preserve inter-variable dependencies and\nspatial structures, and accurately represent extremes at the local scale.\nRecommendation 3: Promote Inclusive Model Development: Ensure Earth System\nModel development is open and accessible to diverse stakeholders, enabling\nforecasters, the public, and AI/statistics experts to use, develop, and engage\nwith the model and its predictions/projections.\n",
