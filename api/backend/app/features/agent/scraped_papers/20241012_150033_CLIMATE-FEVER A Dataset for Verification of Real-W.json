    "abstract": "  We introduce CLIMATE-FEVER, a new publicly available dataset for verification\nof climate change-related claims. By providing a dataset for the research\ncommunity, we aim to facilitate and encourage work on improving algorithms for\nretrieving evidential support for climate-specific claims, addressing the\nunderlying language understanding challenges, and ultimately help alleviate the\nimpact of misinformation on climate change. We adapt the methodology of FEVER\n[1], the largest dataset of artificially designed claims, to real-life claims\ncollected from the Internet. While during this process, we could rely on the\nexpertise of renowned climate scientists, it turned out to be no easy task. We\ndiscuss the surprising, subtle complexity of modeling real-world\nclimate-related claims within the \\textsc{fever} framework, which we believe\nprovides a valuable challenge for general natural language understanding. We\nhope that our work will mark the beginning of a new exciting long-term joint\neffort by the climate science and AI community.\n",
