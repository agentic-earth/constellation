    "abstract": "  Establishing causal relations between random variables from observational\ndata is perhaps the most important challenge in today's Science. In remote\nsensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the\nEarth's system and the complex and elusive interactions between processes. In\nthis paper we explore a framework to derive cause-effect relations from pairs\nof variables via regression and dependence estimation. We propose to focus on\nthe sensitivity (curvature) of the dependence estimator to account for the\nasymmetry of the forward and inverse densities of approximation residuals.\nResults in a large collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems\ndemonstrate the good capabilities of the method.\n",
