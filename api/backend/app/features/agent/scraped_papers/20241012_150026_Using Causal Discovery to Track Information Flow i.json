    "abstract": "  Causal discovery algorithms based on probabilistic graphical models have\nemerged in geoscience applications for the identification and visualization of\ndynamical processes. The key idea is to learn the structure of a graphical\nmodel from observed spatio-temporal data, which indicates information flow,\nthus pathways of interactions, in the observed physical system. Studying those\npathways allows geoscientists to learn subtle details about the underlying\ndynamical mechanisms governing our planet. Initial studies using this approach\non real-world atmospheric data have shown great potential for scientific\ndiscovery. However, in these initial studies no ground truth was available, so\nthat the resulting graphs have been evaluated only by whether a domain expert\nthinks they seemed physically plausible. This paper seeks to fill this gap. We\ndevelop a testbed that emulates two dynamical processes dominant in many\ngeoscience applications, namely advection and diffusion, in a 2D grid. Then we\napply the causal discovery based information tracking algorithms to the\nsimulation data to study how well the algorithms work for different scenarios\nand to gain a better understanding of the physical meaning of the graph\nresults, in particular of instantaneous connections. We make all data sets used\nin this study available to the community as a benchmark.\n  Keywords: Information flow, graphical model, structure learning, causal\ndiscovery, geoscience.\n",
