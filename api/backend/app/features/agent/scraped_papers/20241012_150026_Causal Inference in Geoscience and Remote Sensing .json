    "abstract": "  Establishing causal relations between random variables from observational\ndata is perhaps the most important challenge in today's \\blue{science}. In\nremote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better\nunderstand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the\ngoverning processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference,\nthus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set\nof empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario\nthat requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be\nused. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive\nnoise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause\nand the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such\nprinciple only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward\ndirections, and 2) the estimation of {\\em statistical independence} between the\nobtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more\nindependent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a\ncriterion that uses the {\\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence\nestimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting\nthe dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious\ndetections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal\ninference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and\nmachine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182\nproblems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a\ncarbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves state-of-the-art detection rates\nin all cases, it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions.\n",
