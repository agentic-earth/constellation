    "abstract": "  In the Earth's magnetosphere, there are fewer than a dozen dedicated probes\nbeyond low-Earth orbit making in-situ observations at any given time. As a\nresult, we poorly understand its global structure and evolution, the mechanisms\nof its main activity processes, magnetic storms, and substorms. New Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) methods, including machine learning, data mining, and data\nassimilation, as well as new AI-enabled missions will need to be developed to\nmeet this Sparse Data challenge.\n",
