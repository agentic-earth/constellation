Below is an example prompt you could give to an LLM to perform the described operation:

You are given a list of objects. Each object may represent either a model or a dataset. Each object has at least the fields name, block_type, and description. The dataset objects also include a filepath field. Your task is to:
	1.	Identify the object with block_type = "model" and extract its name value.
	2.	Identify the object with block_type = "dataset" and extract its filepath value.
	3.	Insert the model’s name into the placeholder {xxx} and the dataset’s filepath into the placeholder {yyy} within the provided JSON structure.

Here is the input list of objects:

[
    {
        "name": "vit-fire-detection",
        "block_type": "model",
        "description": "This is vit fire detection model"
    },
    {
        "name": "vit-fire-dataset",
        "block_type": "dataset",
        "description": "This is the dataset for vit fire model",
        "filepath": "1aniasD6RcD3Zr7K8DSWiiqtXCRbFx7gU"
    }
]

From this input, produce the following JSON output:

"ops": {
    "generate_dynamic_job_configs": {
        "config": {
            "raw_input": [
                {
                    "operation": "deploy_model",
                    "parameters": {
                        "model": "{xxx}"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "operation": "import_from_google_drive",
                    "parameters": {
                        "file_id": "{yyy}"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "operation": "delete_model",
                    "parameters": {
                        "service_name": "{xxx}-service"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

Replace {xxx} with the model’s name (block_type = "model") and {yyy} with the dataset’s filepath (block_type = "dataset"). Output only the final JSON without additional explanation or formatting.
