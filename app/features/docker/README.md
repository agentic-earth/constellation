   - Define API endpoints in `app/docker/routes/__init__.py`.
   - Implement business logic in `app/docker/controllers/__init__.py`.
   - Utilize service classes in `app/docker/services/__init__.py` for operations like model packaging, deployment, and image management.

3. **Implementing Services**

   - **ModelService**: Handles packaging, deploying, and managing ML models.
   - **DockerService**: Interacts with Docker APIs to build, push, and pull Docker images.
   - **ValidationService**: Validates code and dependencies to ensure models are runnable.
   - **DeploymentService**: Manages Docker Compose generation and orchestrates deployments.

4. **Testing**

   - Write unit tests for individual functions and classes.
   - Develop integration tests to validate interactions between services.
   - Conduct end-to-end tests to ensure the entire model lifecycle functions correctly.
   - Use `pytest` to run all tests:
     ```bash
     pytest
     ```

5. **Logging and Monitoring**

   - Utilize `Loguru` for structured and consistent logging practices.
   - Monitor logs for errors, warnings, and performance metrics.
   - Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time insights.

6. **Concurrency Handling**

   - Ensure all API endpoints are asynchronous to handle multiple requests efficiently.
   - Use thread-safe operations and proper locking mechanisms when accessing shared resources.

7. **Deployment**

   - Containerize the service using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments.
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment.
   - Consider using Kubernetes for orchestrating deployments in production environments.

8. **Security Practices**
   - Implement secure authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
   - Use environment variables or secret management tools to handle sensitive information.
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

@router.post("/models/{model_id}/deploy/")
async def deploy_model(model_id: UUID):
    """
    Endpoint to deploy an existing ML model as an inference endpoint.
    """
    pass

@router.get("/models/{model_id}/status/")
async def get_model_status(model_id: UUID):
    """
    Endpoint to retrieve the deployment status of a specific ML model.
    """
    pass

@router.delete("/models/{model_id}/")
async def delete_model_deployment(model_id: UUID):
    """
    Endpoint to delete a specific ML model deployment.
    """
    pass

@router.get("/models/")
async def list_all_models():
    """
    Endpoint to list all ML models managed by the Docker Microservice.
    """
    pass

@router.post("/images/pull/")
async def pull_docker_image():
    """
    Endpoint to pull a Docker image from a repository.
    """
    pass

@router.post("/images/push/")
async def push_docker_image():
    """
    Endpoint to push a Docker image to a repository.
    """
    pass
```

## 📈 **Future Enhancements**

1. **Advanced Context Management**:

   - Enhance the ability to manage and utilize context for multi-turn interactions within model deployments.

2. **Enhanced Deployment Options**:

3. **User Feedback Integration**:

   - Implement systems to gather and incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement of deployment processes.

4. **Optimized Resource Management**:

   - Develop mechanisms to optimize resource allocation and usage during model inference and deployment.

5. **Extended Monitoring Capabilities**:

   - Incorporate more detailed metrics and dashboards for comprehensive deployment monitoring and performance tracking.

6. **Security Enhancements**:

   - Implement advanced security measures, including encryption, intrusion detection, and automated threat mitigation, to protect deployed models and data.

7. **Automated Scaling**:

   - Develop automated scaling solutions to adjust resources based on model load and performance requirements dynamically.

8. **Integration with Additional Platforms**:

   - Extend integration capabilities to support deployment on various cloud platforms and orchestration systems, enhancing flexibility and scalability.
